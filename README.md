Project Description

The Installed Games Manager is a web-based application that allows users to track and manage the games installed on their device. Users can view game details such as title, company, size, ratings, and downloads, and easily uninstall games they no longer need. The app also provides sorting functionality by game size (or optionally by downloads) for quick organization.

This project demonstrates effective use of local storage to persist installed game data, dynamic rendering of cards, and interactive UI features like sorting and notifications.
